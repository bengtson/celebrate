# Celebrate

This is a micro service that can be used by other applications.

Celebrate should provide the following basic services:

- List birthdays for given date.
- List birthdays in a given date range.
- List Anniversaries as well but allow for specification of either or both.
- Provide a simple web interface to list birthdays.

File format:

  date :: dd-mmm-yyyy or dd-mmm or mmm-yyyy or mmm
  name :: Michael Bengtson
  type :: Birthday

Define structure for events.
